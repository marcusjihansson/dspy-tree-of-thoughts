these prom pts takes a lot of time and effort, but we’re willing to
spend it since better prom pts usually lead to better results.
However, reaching an op timal prom pt is often a challenging task.
It’s a trial-and-error proc ess, where it’s not always clear what will
wor k best for you r speciﬁc task or a given LLM. As a result, it can
take many iteration s to arrive at a satisfactor y result, especially
when you r prom pt is several thou sand words lon g. 
To address these challenge s, DataBricks launched the DSPy
framewor k. DSPy stands for Declarative Self-improving Python.
This framewor k allows you  to build mod ular AI application s. It is
based on  the idea that LLM tasks can be treated as prog ramming
rather than manual prom pting. Using standard building bloc ks,
you  can create a wide range of AI application s: from  simple
classiﬁers to RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation ) systems or
even age nts. 
This approa ch seems prom ising. It wou ld be exciting to build AI
application s the same way as we build tradition al software. So, I
decided to give DSPy a try.
In this article, we’ll explore the DSPy framewor k and its
capabilities for building LLM pipelines. We’ll start with a simple
com binator ics task to cov er the basics. Then, we’ll apply DSPy to
a real business prob lem: classifying NPS detractor com ments.
Based on  this example, we’ll also test on e of the framewor k’s
mos t prom ising features: autom atic instruction  op timisation .
DSPy basics
We’ll begin explor ing the DSPy framewor k by installing the
package .LATEST

As mention ed abov e, DSPy deﬁnes LLM application s in a
structured and mod ular way. Every application  is built using three
main com pon ents:
language model —  LLM that will answer ou r question s, 
signature — a declaration  of the prog ram’s input and ou tput
(what task we want to solve),
module —  the prom pting technique (how we want to solve the
task).  
Let’s try it ou t with a very simple example.
As usual, we will start with a language mod el —  the core of any
LLM-powered application . I will be using a loc al mod el (Llama by
Meta), accessed via Ollama. If you  don ’t have Ollama installed yet,
you  can follow the instruction s in the doc umentation .
To create a langu age  mod el in a DSPy application , we need to
initialise a dspy.LM  ob ject and set it as a default LLM for ou r app.
It goe s withou t saying that DSPy supports not on ly local mod els
but also pop ular APIs, such as OpenAI and Anthrop ic.
import dspy
llm = dspy.LM('ollama_chat/llama3.2' , 
  api_base ='http://localhost:11434' , 
  api_key ='', temperature = 0.3)
dspy.configure (lm=llm)
We have ou r langu age  mod el set up. The next step is to deﬁne
the task by creating a mod ule and a signature.LATEST

A signature deﬁnes the input and ou tput for the mod el. It tells
the mod el what we’re giving it and what result we expect in the
end. The sign ature doe sn’t specify to the mod el how to solve the
task, it’s on ly a declaration .
There are two ways to deﬁne a signature in DSPy: inline or using
a class. For ou r ﬁrst quick example, we will use a simple inline
approa ch, but we will cov er class-based deﬁnition s later in the
article.
Modules are the building bloc ks of DSPy application s. They
abstract different prom pting strategies, such as Chain-of-
Thou gh t or ReAct. Mod ules are design ed to wor k with any
sign ature, so you  don ’t need to wor ry abou t com patibility
you rself.
Here are som e of the mos t com mon ly used DSPy mod ules (you
can ﬁnd the full list in the doc umentation ): 
dspy.Predict  —  a basic predictor ;
dspy.ChainOfThought  —  gu ides an LLM to think step-by-step
before returning a ﬁnal answer;
dspy.ReAct  —  a basic age nt that can call tool s.
We will start with the simplest version —  dspy.Predict  and will
build a basic mod el that can answer com binator ics question s.
Since we expect an answer to be an integer, I’ve speciﬁed that in
a sign ature.
simple_model = dspy.Predict("question -> answer: int" )
That’s all we need. Now, we can start asking question s.LATEST

We can see that DSPy has generated a detailed and well-
structured prom pt for us. That’s quite handy.
One last quick note before we mov e on  to ﬁxing the mod el: I
noticed that DSPy enables caching for LLM respon ses by default.
Caching migh t be helpful in som e cases, for example, saving
cos ts on  debuggi ng. However, if you  want to disable it, you  can
either update the con ﬁg or bypass it for a speciﬁc call.
# updating config
dspy.configure_cache (enable_memory_cache =False, enable_disk_cache =

math = dspy.Predict("question -> answer: float" , cache = False)
Back to ou r task, let’s try adding reason ing to see if it improv es
the result. It’s as easy as changing the mod ule.

The answer is deﬁnitely wron g. LLM shared the cor rect for mula,
but ga ve 55 instead of the cor rect result (2,042,975). This is
expected. The mod el hallucinated because it cou ldn’t perfor m
the calculation  accurately. So, it’s a perfect use case for an
age nt. We will equip ou r age nt with a tool  to do calculation s and,
hop efully, it will solve the prob lem.
Before we jump to build ou r ﬁrst DSPy agentic ﬂow, let’s set up
ob servability. It will help us understand the agent’s thou ght
proc ess. DSPy is integrated with MLFlow (an ob servability tool ),
making it easy to track everything in a user-friendly interface. 
To begin, we’ll make a cou ple of initial setup calls.
pip install -U mlflow
#  It is highly recommended to use SQL store when using MLflow tra
python3 -m mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mydb.sqlite
If you  haven’t change d the default, MLFlow will be running on
port 50 00. Next, we need to add som e Python  cod e to ou r
progr am to start tracking. That’s it.
import mlflow
# Tell MLflow about the server URI.
mlflow.set_tracking_uri ("http://127.0.0.1:5000" )
# Create a unique name for your experiment.
mlflow.set_experiment ("DSPy")
mlflow.dspy.autolog()
Then, let’s deﬁne a calculation  tool . We will give ou r agent the
superpower to execute Python  cod e.

def evaluate_math (expr: str) -> str:

Now, we have everything we need to create ou r agent. As you  can
see, deﬁning a DSPy age nt is con cise and straightfor ward. 
react_model = dspy.ReAct(
  signature ="question -> answer: int" ,

Overall, the trajector y makes sense. The LLM cor rectly tried to
calculate the number of com bination s with math.comb(25, 9)  . I
didn’t know that such a function  existed, so that was a win.
However, it initially forgo t to import the math mod ule, causing
the execution  to fail. On the next iteration , it cor rected the
Python  cod e and go t the result. For som e reason , thou gh, it
repeated precisely the same action  three more times. Not ideal,
but we still go t ou r answer.
Since we enabled MLFlow, we can also view the com plete log  of
the age nt’s execution  throu gh the UI. It’s often more con venient
than reading the trajector y as plain text.

NPS topic modelling
As we’ve cov ered the basics, let’s take a look  at a real-wor ld
example. Imagine you ’re a prod uct analyst at a fashion  retail
com pany, and you r task is to identify the mos t signiﬁcant
custom er pain points. The com pany regularly con ducts an NPS
survey, so you  decide to base you r analysis on  com ments from
NPS detractors.
Toge ther with you r prod uct team, you  reviewed a bunch of NPS
com ments, look ed throu gh  previou s custom er research and
brainstor med a list of key prob lems that custom ers might be
facing in the prod uct. As a result, you  identiﬁed the following key
top ics:
Slow or Unreliable Shipping,
Inaccurate Prod uct Description  or Photos ,
Limited Size or Shade Availability,
Unrespon sive or Generic Custom er Support,
Website or App Bugs ,
Con fusing Loyalty or Discount Systems,
Com plicated Returns or Exchanges,
Custom s and Import Charges,
Diffi cult Prod uct Discov ery,
Damage d or Incor rect Items.
We have a list of hypotheses and now just need to understand
which prob lems custom ers mention  mos t often. Fortunately, with
LLMs, there’s no need to spend hou rs reading NPS com ments
ou rselves. We will use DSPy to do top ic mod elling. LATEST

Let’s start by deﬁning a sign ature. The mod el will get an NPS
com ment as input, and we expect it to return on e or more top ics
as ou tput. From  a declaration  perspective, ou tput will be an array
of strings  from  a predeﬁned list. Since this use case is a bit more
com plex, we will use a class-based signature for this task. 
We need to create a class that inherits from  dspy.Signature  . This
class shou ld include a doc string that will be shared with the
mod el as its ob jective. We also need to deﬁne the input and
ou tput ﬁelds, alon g with their respective types.
from typing import Literal , List
class NPSTopic (dspy.Signature ):
  """Classify NPS topics"""
  comment : str = dspy.InputField ()
  answer : List[Literal['Slow or Unreliable Shipping' , 
    'Inaccurate Product Descriptions or Photos' , 
    'Limited Size or Shade Availability' , 'Difficult Product Disco

    'Website or App Bugs' , 'Confusing Loyalty or Discount Systems'
    'Complicated Returns or Exchanges' , 'Customs and Import Charge
    'Damaged or Incorrect Items' ]] = dspy.OutputField ()
The next step is to deﬁne the mod ule. Since we don ’t need any
tool s, I will use a chain-of-thou ght prom pting approa ch.
nps_topic_model = dspy.ChainOfThought (NPSTopic )
That’s it. We can give it a try. Based on  a single example, the
mod el perfor ms quite well.

# ["Limited Size or Shade Availability"]
You  migh t be won dering why we’re discussing such a
straigh tfor ward task. It took  us just 2 minutes to build the
prototype. That’s true, but the goa l here is to see how DSPy
op timisation  wor ks in practice using this example.
Optimisation  is on e of the framewor k’s standou t features. DSPy
can autom atically tune the mod el weights and adjust instruction s
to op timise for the evaluation  criteria you  speciﬁed.
There are a bunch of DSPy op timisers available: 
Automatic few-shot learning (for example, BootstrapFewShot
or BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch ) autom atically selects the
best examples and adds them to the signature, implementing
a few-shot learning prom pt.
Automatic instructions optimisation (for example, MIPROv2 )
can simultaneou sly adjust instruction s and select examples
for few-shot learning.
Automatic ﬁne-tuning (for example, BootstrapFinetune )
adjusts the langu age  mod el’s weights.
In this article, I will foc us solely on  instruction  op timisation s. I’ve
decided to start with the MIPROv2 op timiser (which stands for
“Multiprompt Instruction Proposal Optimizer Version 2”), since it
can tweak prom pts and add examples at the same time. For
more details, check the article “Optimizing Instructions and
Demonstrations for Multi-Stage Language Model Programs” by
Opsahl-Ong et al.LATEST

For op timisation , we will need: a DSPy prog ram (which we already
have), a metric and a set of examples (ideally, divided into
training and validation  sets).
For the training set, I synthesised 100 examples of NPS
com ments with labels. Let’s split these into training and
validation  sets. 
trainset = []
valset = []
for rec in nps_data : 
  if random.random() <= 0.5:
    trainset .append(
      dspy .Example(
        comment = rec['comment' ],
        answer = rec['topics' ]
      ).with_inputs ('comment' )
    )
  else: 
    valset .append(
      dspy .Example(
        comment = rec['comment' ],
        answer = rec['topics' ]
      ).with_inputs ('comment' )
    )
Now, let’s deﬁne the function  that will calculate the metric. We
need a custom  function  because the default function
dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match  doe sn’t wor k with arrays.
def list_exact_match (example, pred, trace=None):
  """Custom metric for comparing lists of topics"""
  try:
    pred_answer = pred.answer
    expected_answer = example .answer
      If you’re interested in a ﬁne-tuning example, you can look it up
in the documentation.

    # Convert to sets for order-independent comparison

    else:
      return pred_answer == expected_answer
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error in metric: {e}")
    return False
Now, we have everything we need to start the op timisation
proc ess. 
tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=list_exact_match , auto="light", num_threa
opt_nps_topic_model =  tp.compile(
  nps_topic_model , 
  trainset =trainset , 
  valset =valset,
  requires_permission_to_run = False, provide_traceback =True)
I chos e auto = "light"  to keep the number of iteration s low, but
even with this setting, op timisation  might take quite a lon g time
(60–90 mins).
Once it’s ready, we can run both mod els on  the validation  set and
com pare their results.

We’ve ga ined a sign iﬁcant improv ement in accuracy: from  62.3%
to 82%. That’s a really cool  result. 
Let’s com pare the prom pts to see what changed. The op timiser
updated the ob jective from  a high-level on e, “Classify NPS
topics”, that we initially deﬁned, to a more speciﬁc on e: “Classify
customer feedback comments related to online shopping issues,
such as website bugs, product availability, and inaccurate
descriptions, into relevant NPS topics.” Addition ally, the algor ithm
selected ﬁve examples to include in the prom pt.

I tried a simpler version  of the op timiser

Summary
In this article, we’ve explored the DSPy framewor k and its
capabilities. Now, it’s time to wrap things up with a quick
summary.
DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) is a mod ular,
declarative framewor k for building AI application s, develop ed
by DataBricks. 
Its core philos op hy is “Programming — not prompting — LMs”.
So, the framewor k encou rages you  to create application s
using structured building bloc ks like mod ules or signatures
rather than handcrafted prom pts. While I really like the idea
of building LLM application s more like tradition al software,
I’ve grown so accustom ed to prom pting that it feels
som ewhat uncom fortable to give up this level of con trol.
The mos t impressive feature of the framewor k is deﬁnitely
op timisers. DSPy allows you to autom atically improv e the
pipelines either by tuning prom pts (both adjustingYou can ﬁnd the full code on GitHub. LATEST
