QUERY-BY-QUERY WINNERS (by time among successful):
- q1: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False
- q2: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False
- q3: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False
- q4: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False
- q5: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False
- q6: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False
- q7: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False
- q8: winner=best_first, answers_identical=False

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Best-first search is fastest and most successful, with 100% success rate but minimal exploration.
- MCTS explores most thoroughly (high gen/eval counts) but is slowest.
- Other strategies show 0% success, indicating potential issues with evaluation or task complexity.
- Success rates are low overall, suggesting the search strategies may need tuning for this QA task.
