  "final_answer": " DSPy (pronounced \u201cdee\u2011ess\u2011pie\u201d) is an open\u2011source Python framework for building and optimizing pipelines that use large language models (LLMs).  Rather than hand\u2011crafting long prompt strings, DSPy lets you **program** LLM\u2011driven applications by composing modular, declarative components:\n\n1. **Signatures** \u2013 Typed specifications that describe the input and output of a text\u2011transformation step (e.g., `question -> answer`).  They replace raw prompt templates with a clear contract for what a module should do.\n\n2. **Modules** \u2013 Reusable building blocks that implement a signature.  Examples include `Predict` (basic few\u2011shot prompting), `ChainOfThought` (step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning), `ReAct` (tool\u2011using agents), and retrieval modules.  Modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn from demonstrations or be fine\u2011tuned.\n\n3. **Teleprompters** \u2013 Optimizers (or \u201ccompilers\u201d) that automatically generate and improve the prompts or fine\u2011tune the underlying model.  They bootstrap useful demonstrations, perform random\u2011search or Bayesian hyper\u2011parameter tuning, and can even fine\u2011tune smaller models to emulate larger ones.\n\n**How it works**\n\n- **Define the task** by writing a DSPy program in Python: declare the needed modules, connect them with ordinary control flow (if\u2011else, loops, etc.), and specify the signature for each step.\n- **Provide a small training set** (often just a few examples, labeled or unlabeled).  The compiler uses this data together with a user\u2011defined metric (e.g., exact\u2011match, F1) to evaluate candidate prompt configurations.\n- **Compile the program** with a teleprompter such as `BootstrapFewShot`, `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`, or `MIPROv2`.  During compilation the framework:\n  1. Simulates the program on the training examples.\n  2. Collects traces of each module\u2019s inputs/outputs.\n  3. Selects or generates high\u2011quality few\u2011shot demonstrations and/or fine\u2011tunes the model.\n- **Run the optimized pipeline** as ordinary Python code.  DSPy handles prompt construction, caching, and tool integration automatically, allowing the developer to focus on the high\u2011level logic rather than prompt engineering.\n\nThe result is a self\u2011improving LLM pipeline that can be built with a few lines of code, works across different models (GPT\u20113.5, Llama\u202f2, T5, etc.), and often outperforms hand\u2011written prompt chains by a large margin.  DSPy\u2019s modularity also makes it easy to experiment with new architectures, swap components, or adapt to new domains without rewriting prompts.\n\nFor more details and examples, see the official repository: https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy.",
