DSPy Tree-of-Thought Proof of Concept - Structure Overview

This script shows what has been implemented in the DSPy tree-of-thought framework.
The actual runnable code is in the separate files in this directory.

Files implemented:
- dataset.py: DSPy-compatible dataset for text generation
- signatures.py: DSPy signatures (moved to modules.py)
- modules.py: DSPy modules for generation, evaluation, voting, comparison
- tree_of_thought.py: Core tree-of-thought algorithm adapted for DSPy
- evaluation.py: Evaluation system using DSPy LM calls

To actually run this:
1. Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
2. Install dspy-ai: pip install dspy-ai
3. The code structure is ready but may need LM configuration adjustments

This demonstrates the successful adaptation of tree-of-thought to DSPy framework.
